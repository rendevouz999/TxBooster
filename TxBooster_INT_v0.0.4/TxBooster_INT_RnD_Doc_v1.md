**Description:**  
TxBooster_INT is an intelligent Android performance optimization system that combines adaptive networking, self-learning behavior tuning, and a hybrid operational model that works on both rooted and non-rooted devices. It evolves through real-time feedback exchange between devices via a global *shelter network*, maintaining balance between performance, stability, and visual experience.

### 2.2 Patent (Innovation & Technical Method)

#### Title:
**“Hybrid Adaptive Network Booster with AI Self-Learning Shelter System for Android”**

#### Abstract:
This invention provides a hybrid performance enhancement mechanism for Android devices (rooted and non-rooted) that can self-learn and adapt through distributed performance data sharing. The system introduces a *server shelter* model to allow global learning exchange while maintaining user device safety, privacy, and adaptive fallback protection against bootloop or tweak conflict.

#### Claim Summary:
1. **Hybrid Tuning Core** – Ability to execute low-level (root) and user-space (non-root) tweaks dynamically.  
2. **AI Self-Learning Engine** – Self-adjusts parameters (txqueuelen, MTU, scheduler, buffer size) based on historical device profiling.  
3. **Server Shelter Synchronization** – A central data relay (cloud or local node) where devices exchange anonymized learning results.  
4. **Adaptive Fallback & Anti-Bootloop Layer** – Automatically detects unsafe tweaks or module conflicts and triggers a safe mode disabling all conflicting modules.  
5. **Auto-Update Reinforcement** – Devices synchronize improvement patches autonomously via the shelter network.  
6. **Cross-Mode Evolution** – Enables non-root devices to benefit from root-learned optimization through predictive AI adaptation.  

#### Unique Differentiation:
- Works in both *rooted* and *non-rooted* environments seamlessly.  
- Uses network-based distributed learning rather than static config-based tuning.  
- Features self-healing and rollback to maintain device stability.  

#### Implementation Status:
Prototype implemented in **TxBooster_INT_v0.0.3**  
Planned full AI-shelter integration in **TxBooster_INT_v0.0.5+**

### 2.3 Trademark / Brand Protection

**Registered Name:** TxBooster_INT  
**Proposed Sub-Brand:** TxHybrid Engine / TxShelter Core  

#### Logo / Identifier:
Simple “TxBooster_INT” wordmark with adaptive circuit design (to be developed).

#### Classifications (Nice Classification reference):
- **Class 9:** Computer software, mobile optimization applications, system modules.  
- **Class 42:** Software as a service (SaaS) for adaptive performance learning.  

#### Usage Rights:
- Exclusive use of “TxBooster_INT” name and derivatives (TxBooster, TxHybrid, TxShelter).  
- All promotional materials, app identifiers, and modules must carry attribution to **Jxey**.

## 🧠 3. System Concept Summary

### a. Three Operational Modes
| Mode | Purpose | Characteristics |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| **High Performance Mode** | Max throughput | Aggressive MTU/txqueuelen tuning, high buffer |
| **Self-Learn for Stability** | AI adaptive tuning | Learns from logs & history.csv |
| **Visual Engagement Mode** | Enhanced UX visuals | Adjusts animations, brightness, smoothness |

### b. Hybrid System Design
- **Root Devices:** Full kernel/network tweak access.  
- **Non-Root Devices:** Uses userspace emulation, AI-based prediction, and limited access tweaks.  
- **Synchronization:** Both device types exchange results through *TxShelter Network*.
